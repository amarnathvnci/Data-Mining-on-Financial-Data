# Project 03 - Data Mining on Financial Data
 In this project

Various models like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM and Random Forest have been applied to three of fintech related datasets in order to discover the insights from the datasets. The methods will be applied to the datasets in R studio and corresponding outputs will be shown in this paper. Then the applied methods will be compared with each other to identify how well the method is performing on each of the datasets and then finally the better method will be chosen for each of the datasets. The methods were explained in detail along with their advantages with the help of the information from the relevant papers. Every method which has been applied to the datasets has been confirmed whether it follows the data mining methodologies. Data mining methodologies like CRISP-DM, KDD and SEMMA will also be explained in detail via this paper. The process flow of the data mining methodologies will be explained and also will be made sure that whether the process flow has been followed while applying each method on the datasets. The Data mining in now considered as a major factor of the risk management process of the financial institutions. Even though various data mining tools are existing in the market, this paper allows readers to understand how the algorithm works on the dataset and how to justify that whether algorithm’s prediction.
